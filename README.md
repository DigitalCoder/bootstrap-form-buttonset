# bootstrap-form-buttonset

This small plugin will skin checkboxes and radios with Bootstraps button groups. The origin inputs will be synced with
the current button states. The inputs are always ready to submit. No additional changes or scripts are needed to convert
the button states to form values.

This plugin is compatible to **Bootstrap 2** an **Bootstrap 3**.
